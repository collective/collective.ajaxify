# collective.ajaxify

This is an experiment to ajaxify a whole Plone site.
It is the basis for the Ploneconf 2025 talk "Ajaxifying Plone" by Johannes Raggam and is itsef based on the rendering approach in sfd.at.

This package depends on Plone 6.2 for the `plone.use_ajax_main_template` registry setting and uses Mockup with the `thet-improvement` branch.
